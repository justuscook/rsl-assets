Howdy folks.  With the help of other Raid Devs, especailly Callous and Zerlf, I have deveopled a way to quicly extract Raid: Shadow Lengends champion avatar and skill images, as well as their base stats and data.  My Discord bot Arbie will use this data so you can look up champion info with our going into the game index!

I have this were it could be access via a REST api with my the Arpie bot, however I am still working on hosting this server on a machine that will be online most of the time and able to launch Raid to pickup added champions.

Feel free to use this data for anything you like and open an issue if there are mistakes!
